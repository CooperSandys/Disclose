# Disclose

Welcome to Disclose! Disclose is a messaging service based on a client-server framework, and as such the Disclose Server and Disclose Client workspaces have been included in this
repo (they are both Eclipse workspaces).

This README will not be a full guide on working with whatever firewall you have installed, nor is this a guide on how to work with port forwarding. However, keep in mind that
both of those things may or may not be necessary to make your server accessible to the wider internet (As opposed to just your machine or local area network). For guides 
on these topics, I would suggest Minecraft server setup tutorials.

Once a server is up, you may share your IP (cautiously) with those that you would like to have access to your server.

On the other end, with the Disclose Client, simply double-clicking on the DiscloseClient.jar file will start it up (provided you have an appropriate Java install, the one Disclose
is built on can be found here: https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/16/).

The program will then prompt you with what inputs you need. The first thing should be the IP of whatever Disclose server you're looking to connect to. The next is your username, 
keep in mind that usernames have a max length of 30 characters.

Have fun disclosing whatever you like, and thank you for using Disclose!
